    brief: List Memorystore
    description: List a Memorystore resource.
    examples: |-
        To list a resource, run:

        $ {command}
arguments:
    params:
        - arg_name: pageSize
          api_field: page_size
          help_text: |-
            Optional. The maximum number of items to return.

            If not specified, a default value of 1000 will be used by the service.
            Regardless of the page_size value, the response may include a partial list
            and a caller should only rely on response's
            [`next_page_token`][google.cloud.memorystore.v1.ListBackupsResponse.next_page_token]
            to determine if there are more clusters left to be queried.
          required: true
        - arg_name: pageToken
          api_field: page_token
          help_text: |-
            Optional. The `next_page_token` value returned from a previous
            [ListBackupCollections] request, if any.
          required: true

    api_version: v1
