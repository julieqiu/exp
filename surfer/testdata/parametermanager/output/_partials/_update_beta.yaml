    brief: Update ParameterManager
    description: Update a ParameterManager resource.
    examples: |-
        To update a resource, run:

        $ {command}
arguments:
    params:
        - arg_name: updateMask
          api_field: update_mask
          help_text: |-
            Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the
            ParameterVersion resource by the update.
            The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not
            the full request. A mutable field will be overwritten if it is in the
            mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all mutable fields present
            in the request will be overwritten.
        - arg_name: parameterVersion
          api_field: parameter_version
          help_text: Required. The ParameterVersion resource being updated
        - arg_name: requestId
          api_field: request_id
          help_text: |-
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
            request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
            guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
            request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
            was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
            clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
            not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
