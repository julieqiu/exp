    brief: Update Parallelstore
    description: Update a Parallelstore resource.
    examples: |-
        To update a resource, run:

        $ {command}
arguments:
    params:
        - arg_name: updateMask
          api_field: update_mask
          help_text: |-
            Required. Mask of fields to update. Field mask is used to specify the
            fields to be overwritten in the Instance resource by the update. At least
            one path must be supplied in this field. The fields specified in the
            update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request.
        - arg_name: instance
          api_field: instance
          help_text: Required. The instance to update.
        - arg_name: requestId
          api_field: request_id
          help_text: |-
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
            request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
            guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t
            he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
            was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
            clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
            not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
          required: true
