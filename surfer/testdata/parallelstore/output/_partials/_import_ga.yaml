    brief: Import Parallelstore
    description: Import a Parallelstore resource.
    examples: |-
        To import a resource, run:

        $ {command}
arguments:
    params:
        - arg_name: sourceGcsBucket
          api_field: source_gcs_bucket
          help_text: The Cloud Storage source bucket and, optionally, path inside the bucket.
        - arg_name: destinationParallelstore
          api_field: destination_parallelstore
          help_text: Parallelstore destination.
        - arg_name: requestId
          api_field: request_id
          help_text: |-
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
            request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
            guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t
            he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
            was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
            clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
            not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
          required: true
        - arg_name: serviceAccount
          api_field: service_account
          help_text: |-
            Optional. User-specified service account credentials to be used when
            performing the transfer.

            Use one of the following formats:

            * `{EMAIL_ADDRESS_OR_UNIQUE_ID}`
            * `projects/{PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS_OR_UNIQUE_ID}`
            * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS_OR_UNIQUE_ID}`

            If unspecified, the Parallelstore service agent is used:
            `service-<PROJECT_NUMBER>@gcp-sa-parallelstore.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
          required: true
        - arg_name: name
